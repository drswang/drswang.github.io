    <p><b>Welcome to SWx: Severe Weather Research Lab!</b></p>
    
    <h2 class="section-header">What we do</h2>
    <p>We focus on severe weather phenomena in coastal regions, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Understanding their unique characteristics</li>
      <li>Unraveling their complexities when coupled</li>
      <li>Improving forecasting capabilities and preparedness</li>
    </ul>
    
<!--     <p>At SWx, we are dedicated to unraveling the complexities of severe weather in coastal regions. Our lab focuses on the study of high-impact meteorological phenomena, such as high winds, heavy rainfall, intense temperatures, and towering ocean waves towards coasts. These atmospheric and oceanic disturbances are often triggered by landfalling tropical cyclones (hurricanes & typhoons), explosive extratropical cyclones (known as "weather bombs"), and other synoptic events, posing significant challenges to the safety and resilience of coastal communities.</p>
    <p>Our research efforts are primarily centered on understanding the unique characteristics of severe weather in coastal regions. We strive to enhance forecasting capabilities, improve preparedness, and bolster resilience against these hazardous natural events. Beyond forecasting, our curiosity drives us to explore the underlying physics and dynamics of these severe weather events. By employing cutting-edge numerical modeling, statistical data analytics, and theory development, we endeavor to unlock a deeper comprehension of the fundamental processes that drive these phenomena.</p>
    <p>Our ultimate goal is to contribute to the scientific community's knowledge, develop more accurate predictive tools, and foster a profound understanding of the potential changes that may occur in a warming climate.</p> -->
